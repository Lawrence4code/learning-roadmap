# Learning-Roadmap üìñüó∫
A repository to keep track of my roadmap to being a more knowledgeable developer

## Why I decided to make this? ü§î
I wanted to make this because I felt lost, without a clear direction of where I wanted to take my career. I want to be the best developer I can be, which means I need a roadmap.

## My intentions with this roadmap ‚û°Ô∏è
I hope to become a "senior" developer within the next five years. My goal is to use this roadmap to guide my learning inside & outside of the office.
