# Learning-Roadmap

A repository to keep track of my Developer Roadmap to being a more knowledgeable and effective developer.

## Why I decided to make this?

Venturing into techinical field (Full Stack Developer) from a non-techinical (Credit Analyst) field, makes me feel there's so much to learn and in persuit to more and everything, sometime I get lost into serveral concepts/projects and lose my track.

Somebody more wiser than me advised me to create such roadmap and stick to it. This repository contains all the goals for next 5 years, list of concept, course, project and cerification that I want to pursue and achieve within the defined time.

## My intentions with this Roadmap

To give myself more structure and a clear picture on where I will be (skill-wise) within the next five years. My goal is to use this Roadmap to guide my learning inside & outside of the office.
